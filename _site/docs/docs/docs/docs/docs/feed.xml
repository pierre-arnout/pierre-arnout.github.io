Long story short, I took my camera to the beach, it’s full of sand now.</p>

<p>So before going to a trip I got a new camera, same brand, same model, still an EOS 300, it’s cheap, it works great and I can keep using all my lens. But the guy gave me a little something with the camera - two Kokak Gold 400.</p>

<p>And this how it has started..</p>

<!--exc-end-->

<p>I don’t usually do color films, not that I don’t like color but black and white is already complicated enough and it requires a whole bunch of new chemicals. But I’m now holding two rolls of color films out of the lab and of course I want to print my pictures.</p>

<p>I know printing color film on black and white paper is possible, I already had success using old familly films. Usually all you have to do is to push contrasts a little and you get a nice print.</p>

<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>

<p>Ok so it should be easy, right?</p>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<p><img src="/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-1.jpg" alt="Picture color" /></p>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<p><img src="/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-2.jpg" alt="Picture black and white" /></p>

</div></div>

<p>This is Ardèche. I know right.</p>

<p>I was already excited to the idea of printing this shot. With a fairly big black border and big marges to the edge of the sheet would look dope.</p>

<h2 id="reality">Reality</h2>

<p><img src="/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-3.jpg" alt="Test strip #1" /></p>

<p>If you can’t read test strips, well this one, it’s bad.</p>

<p>Why? I have no clue, I don’t do color films but for sure it dramatically lacks of contrast and I’m already at the maximum filter.</p>

<p>No burning or dodging will help here, it’s too flat. But I want my picture printed, it’s memories!</p>

<p>So what are my options?</p>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<h4 id="mono-graded-paper">Mono graded paper</h4>

<p>Using mono graded paper may work. Multigrade paper react to many color temperatures, this is how it handle several grades to a same paper, by stacking emultions, one color and contrast by emultion.</p>

<p>Maybe getting some mono graded 4 paper would give me better results, but I have none at home and they are very hard to find.</p>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<h4 id="dilution">Dilution</h4>

<p>The more the dilution of revelator is high the more it will create contrast, the thing here is it will not do the trick. The amount of constrat to fill-in is so big even a stock (no dilution) would not work.</p>

<p>There are some specials revelator that gives higher contrasts but again it will probably not fix the issue.</p>

</div></div>

<h4 id="but-there-may-be-another-way">But there may be another way..</h4>

<p>Finding the right paper and developer may work but is hard to replicate. I would rather find a way that can be easily replicated, that’s the thing with film photography - the more it’s replicable the better it is, because no one can tell what developer will still be in sale in 10 years.</p>

<p>But I may have an idea..</p>

<h3 id="orthochromatic-film">Orthochromatic film</h3>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<p><img src="https://labo-argentique.com/218-large_default/ilford-ortho-plus-80-1-film.jpg?20240621134256" alt="Ilford Ortho 80 film" /></p>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<p>In my readings about monochromatic pictures I realised there one film that stands out in a particular way - Orthocromatics films.</p>

<p>In the old age where printers weren’t available for everyone, copying a document using black and white paper was a thing and to do so you would need a very specific kind of film, Ortho films.</p>

<h4 id="a-tone-of-contrast">A tone of contrast</h4>

<p>When copying a text document you don’t need a tone of greys but most likely some pure whites and pure blacks and that is why ortho films brings a lot of constrat, way more than any ordinary film.</p>

<h4 id="no-reaction-to-red-light">No reaction to red light</h4>

<p>Because you don’t need a lot of granularity on greys you don’t have to stack many emultions to the film.</p>

<p>That’s great because you can avoid all emultions that react to red light, so you can use your film into your darkroom’s safe light.</p>

</div></div>

<p>I happen to have some ortho-chromatic film at home, so there may be a way to finally print my image without having to order anything from the internet.</p>

<h3 id="the-plan">The plan</h3>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<p>By stacking a piece of ortho film under the color film and exposing this stack to the light it would print a shadow of the original image to the ortho-chromatic film.</p>

<p>And because it’s ortho I will be able to do that under red light.</p>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<p><img src="/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-5.jpg" alt="Films stacking" /></p>

</div></div>

<ul>
  <li class="hidden cmb-2"></li>
</ul>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<p>That will produce a positive image on my ortho-chromatic film.</p>

<p>From there I will have to repeat this step but using my positive image instead of the color film and I should get a negative, black and white, fairly constrated piece of film.</p>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<p><img src="/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-4.jpg" alt="Expected steps" /></p>

</div></div>

<ul>
  <li class="hidden cmb-2"></li>
</ul>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<p class="cmt-1"><img src="/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-6.jpg" alt="Black and white test #1" /></p>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<h4 id="exposure">Exposure</h4>

<p>There is no more doc or dev chart to follow from there, I’m out in the wild and I need to find my own way.</p>

<p>The first thing I need to figure out is exposure, how many light to send through the stack of films. I’m looking for the more details in the shadows and the highlights.</p>

<p>At this point contrast doesn’t matters, only exposure. In my case 10 seconds at f/22 seems to be good enough.</p>

</div></div>

<ul>
  <li class="hidden cmb-2"></li>
</ul>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<h4 id="contrast">Contrast</h4>

<p>Ok now the real deal, contrast.</p>

<p>When printing an image you can use Multigrade or color filters to handle contrasts, but in this situation no filters will help. I will have to use another way, the only one left - developer’s dilution.</p>

<p>The more concentrate the developer is, the more contrast it will bring. So my next step will be to find the right dilution to brings contrasts back.</p>

<p>I used a 1+20 dilution for finding exposure because it’s the more common usage of Rodinal which make it a good starting point.</p>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<p><img src="/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-7.jpg" alt="Black and white test #1" /></p>

</div></div>

<p>Don’t forget that I will have to repeat this step to get a negative image. I have two baths of developer to get to the final constrat, the first step (positive film) can lack a bit of contrast until I bring enough to fill the gap to the last bath.</p>

<hr class="cmb-2 cmt-2" />

<h3 id="first-major-issue">First major issue</h3>

<p>So I have my positive film, right now it’s not constrated enough but this is not the main issue here. Only by looking at the positive I can tell it lacks of sharpness, a lot.</p>

<p>A frame from a 135 film format is 35mm wide, that’s very small and any little issue on the film will be enlarged while printing it so it needs to be perfect and the fact I can tell I lack of sharpness just by looking at the film is a big issue.</p>

<p>Solution one is to keep trying over and over until I get something clean. It will cost a lot of film and time and will be not repeatable easily.</p>

<p>Second solution is.. to get more film. Ortho Plus is sold in many different formats, 135 and 120 are rolled up but 4”x5” are flat. This should help in many ways since it will not rolls back (instead of sticking flat to the suface) and I will have more room to work with.</p>

<p>So yeah.. That 80 euros for 25 sheets of Ortho Plus 4”x5”.. I placed an order, it should arrive next week. Let’s see how it goes.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A year ago I was shooting a lot of films.

<ol>
  <li>Be offline</li>
  <li>Bring no frustations</li>
  <li>Allow creativity when writing an article</li>
</ol>

<p>Any static blogging system will do the job except for the last part about creativity, about this they all sucks. That remind me of Mutt’s headline: “<em>All mail clients sucks. This one just sucks less</em>”.</p>

<p>Well Markdown do not suck, I love it. It’s smart, it’s efficient and it’s both readable in its natural form and HTML, but for this blog I need more.</p>

<!--exc-end-->

<p>This blog will mainly be focused around film photography and to show my pictures, to document my processes, log my attempts I need to write article that are not linear.</p>

<p>I want to be able to have a picture on the left with some text on its right, then the opposite, later to have 3 images displayed next to each other, etc.</p>

<p>Markdown is not made for this and it makes sens, but I want a Markdown with more features, a Markdown connected to Bootstrap.</p>

<p>Bootstrap is full of great features for that kind of simple blogs. With a few tweaks to the default Bootstrap CSS and a few more lines of custom CSS I got decent looking website, that’s great. If only I could use some Bootstrap feature through Markdown editing that would be dope.</p>

<p>The grid system, this is where it’s at. If I could control Bootstrap’s grid system over Markdown 80% of frustrations would go away, so let’s do that.</p>

<h2 id="bootdown">Bootdown</h2>

<p>Bootdown is (or.. will be) a Markdown parser made for Bootstrap.</p>

<h3 id="grid-system">Grid system</h3>

<p>You probably already know that, Bootstrap comes with a gread grid system. It’s probably the best feature Bootstrap has to offer but unfortunately we can’t control this over Markdown so let’s add this.</p>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<p>This piece of code</p>

<pre><code>{}&gt;&gt;
Foo
{}&gt;
Bar
{}&gt;
Baz
&lt;&lt;
</code></pre>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<p>Would give</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col-4"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="col-4"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="col-4"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

</div></div>

<p>Let’s break down this syntax</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>{}&gt;&gt;</code> opens a new <code>row</code> and <code>col</code></li>
  <li><code>{}&gt;</code> close last <code>col</code> and open a new one</li>
  <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> close both <code>col</code> and <code>row</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<p>You can get more specific:</p>

<pre><code>{}&gt;&gt;
Small
{8}&gt;
Big
{}&gt;
Small
&lt;&lt;
</code></pre>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<p>Would give</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col-2"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="col-8"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="col-2"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

</div></div>

<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>

<p>Most Bootstrap features comes in the form of CSS classes, so adding ability to control it through Bootdown would open a whole lot of possiblities.</p>

<p><a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/">Kramdown</a>, the default Markdown parser for <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> already offers this. This is why so far this blog is generated by Jekyll, by pure lazyness.
So yes, Jekyll is old, almost deprecated but for now it will do the job.</p>

<p>Here is how Kramdown handle CSS attributes to HTML elements</p>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<pre><code># Heading 1
{: .class-name #id-name}
</code></pre>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<pre><code>&lt;h1 class="class-name" id="id-name"&gt;Header 1&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

</div></div>

<p>This would work, but if I had to implement my own Markdown parser I would probably change it a little to make it less verbose:</p>

<pre><code># Heading 1
{.class-name #id-name}
</code></pre>

<p>To me this work the same but is slightly less verbose, so why not. This syntax would also help me to introduce ids and classes to the grid system:</p>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<pre><code>{.class-name}&gt;&gt;
Foo
{8 #id-name}&gt;
Bar
&lt;&lt;
</code></pre>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<pre><code>&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col-4 class-name"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="col-8" id="id-name"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

</div></div>

<p>This two features, grid and CSS classes, covers 90% of my needs. All the rest can be achieved with some minor tricks.</p>

<h3 id="image-captions">Image captions</h3>

<p>This blog is about pictures so it makes sens to bring some more feature around it.</p>

<p>I would like to let me switch from two usages easily,</p>

<ol>
  <li>When I want my images to show caption</li>
  <li>When I don’t want my images to show caption</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li class="hidden cmb-1"></li>
</ul>

<p>Ok so here is the default syntax for images</p>

<pre><code>![Picture title](/foo.jpg)
</code></pre>

<p>In most cases I want this to only show a picture:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="/foo.jpg" alt="Picture title"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But sometimes I want the caption to show</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="img"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/foo.jpg" alt="Picture title"&gt;
    &lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Picture title&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That would allow me to do stuff like</p>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-6">

<p><img src="/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-1.jpg" alt="Picture one" /></p>

<p class="caption">Color picture</p>

</div><div class="col-md-6">

<p><img src="/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-2.jpg" alt="Picture two" /></p>

<p class="caption">Black and white picture</p>

</div></div>

<p>Here is my proposal</p>

<pre><code>![Picture one]{/foo.jpg}
</code></pre>

<p>Just by switching <code>()</code> (no captions) to <code>{}</code> (captions on) should do the trick but I’m still hesitating about this one, it’s not very explicit but for now it will avoid me the struggle of typing</p>

<pre><code>![Black and white picture](/images/photography/02-useless-attempts-test-2.jpg)

Black and white picture
{: .caption}
</code></pre>

<p>to achieve the same result.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="code" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my book a quality blogging system must Be offline Bring no frustations Allow creativity when writing an article Any static blogging system will do the job except for the last part about creativity, about this they all sucks.
